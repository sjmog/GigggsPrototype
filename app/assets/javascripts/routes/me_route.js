//we're building this great platform called 'me'. It'll give you access to real-time analytics about your events: how many people viewed them, (with explicit permission) their demographics, and allow you a place to store and share data, like movies, photos and documents, from past events. Gigggs' 'Me' will be the best place for your business to keep a geographically, chronologically sensible catalogue of all past activities. It'll be the best place for you to store the memories of the events that helped your company grow, and the pivotal decisions: up-to-date, real-time. That's all stored in the cloud, but thanks to sensible export options you can keep copies for offline use, too. We don't make any claim to any of the content you upload to Gigggs. Want to know what was decided in meeting room 4 on Tuesday? Just look for the room, set the time, and access all the relevant documents and notes uploaded as a record of the event.
